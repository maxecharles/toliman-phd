# TOLIMAN

The primary goal of the TOLIMAN mission is to discover Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our own. To achieve this, the mission will employ a novel telescope design that will be able to detect subtle changes in the positions of the Alpha Centauri stars. These changes are caused by the gravitational reflex motion induced by an Earth-sized companion, and this cutting-edge technology will enable scientists to identify exoplanets too small to be detected by conventional telescopes.
